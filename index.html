	<h2>What Do I Do ?</h2>
	<p>Basically I am just a high school student who is in grade 12 and is pretty bored in life.<br>So I decided to learn programming and web-development and i have been learning it for about 2 years now.<br>That is why I am really good at creating website/webpage.<br>I made this website/webpage using HTML&CSS both programming languages that I learned on my own.</p>	
	
	<h2>Why Did I Create This Page ?</h2>
	<p>Well because I am giving a speech on <strong>"WHY COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY DEGREES ARE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WE THINK THEY ARE".</strong><br>I want to show my classmates and other people that we can learn anything new online if we have the will to do it.<br>And that it can help us shape our future.<br>Just like how i learned Web-Development online and made this website.</p>
