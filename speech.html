  <p>I'm going to be starting off with Elon Musk the founder and CEO of TESLA a automobile company.Born and raised in South Africa Elon Musk was always fond of technology and computers.At the age of 12 Elon Musk had built his own computer game which was sold to a company.He further took a loan from his father and invested it in building a online money tranfser app with his best friend which is today known as PAYPAL.Elon Musk further took the money he earned from PAYPAL and started an eco-friendly electric automobile company known as TESLA.<br>TESLA was a huge success as it was the first ever self-driving electric car made.Elon Musk is now ranked the richest man in the world.Elon Musk learned Computer Programming all by himself.I bet most of you sitting here did not know about Elon Musk or that he was originally from South Africa.</p>
